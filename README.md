  <b>About Me</b>
  <p>Hello, I have grown up and lived in Georgia my whole life. I currently live in Buford with my wife Jennifer, and my son Oliver who just turned two in October.
    We love to go out and explore, we hope that once the pandemic resitrcitions ease we can travel outside of the state more frequently and eventually out of the country.
    I never saw my self as a person who would want to pursue an education beyond highschool but once i left the Marine Corps in 2018 and worked a job that i was not Passionate about i decided to use my G.I. Bill to pursue my degree in SoftWare Application Development and Human Computer Interaction.</p>
